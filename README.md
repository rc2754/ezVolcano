# ezVolcano
ezVolcano is a user-friendly Shiny R app for creating interactive volcano plots. Designed for data visualization in bioinformatics, this tool allows full customization of aesthetic settings through a graphic user interface. Simply upload your dataset and explore results dynamically. Click on data points to add/remove annotations, and drag labels for precise positioning.

The online web app is available here:

## Local setup
In addition to the online version, you can download the .R scripts and run them locally through RStudio. 

1. Download `server.R` and `ui.R` and place these scripts in a folder
2. Open RStudio and run the app with the following code (make sure to change `setwd` to wherever you placed the scripts):

```bash
library(shiny)
setwd("C:/Users/chpsh/Desktop/ezVolcano")
runApp()
```
You'll need these R packages installed:

```bash
install.packages(c("shiny", "plotly", "data.table", "dplyr", "shinyjs", "readxl"))
```

## Usage

### Data upload format
Use the `Load data file` button to load your data file. It can be `.txt` `.csv` `.tsv` or `.xslx` (first sheet only).

1. First column must be your gene name or other identifier
2. Second column must be your fold change or other effect size
3. Third column must be your p-value or other statistical significance value

Additional columns are ignored.

### Saving results
Use the `Save plot` button to save all of your datapoints, labels, and aesthetic settings. 
Use the `Save configuration` button to save only your aesthetic settings. 
These save files can be reloaded for later use.

Use the camera button on the Plotly toolbar to export as .PNG file.

Example files are available for download in the app.

### Adding data point labels
There are three ways to add/remove data point labels:

1. Directly clicking on data points
2. Using the `Select labels` selectInput
3. Using the `Batch input` button (space or comma delimited)

### Settings for the x-axis
By default, ezVolcano converts the original fold changes on the x-axis to Z-scores. This ensures consistent thresholds across different data analysis pipelines and experimental conditions.

The threshold values for original fold changes and Z-scores do not interconvert and are set separately.

## Credit
`ezVolcano` was developed by Richard Chen.

`ezVolcano` adapted source code from the `easylabel` R package by Myles Lewis (https://github.com/myles-lewis/easylabel) for interactive labels.
